# Java Image Manipulation Project
#### Takes image input from file path or URL.

<br />

#### It then converts each pixel RGBA value into an integer. This is stored in a 2D array that can be manipulated.

<br />

#### These integers are sometimes converted to RGBA arrays to be manipulated, to create a filter for example. 

<br />

#### Methods do various things like invert image, filter pixel colors, and other pixel manipulation. (check out the images directory)

<br />

#### The integer arrays are finally converted back to an image and output to file.
