# Java Image Manipulation Project
#### Takes image in from file path or URL
#### It then converts each pixel RGBA value into an integer. This is stored in a 2D array that can be manipulated.
#### These integers are sometimes converted to RGBA arrays to be manipulated. To create a filter for example. 
#### Methods do various things like invert image, filter pixel colors, and other pixel manipulation.
#### Then these integer arrays are converted back to an image and output to file.
